# Roadtrip Cost Simulator
A little program to help calculate the cost of a road trip. Intended for a road trip where a car is rented and with the passengers flying back. It can be used for a round trip by omitting flight costs and doubling the distance.

## Features
* Simulates the price for a road trip for a range of passengers and duration so that cost can be compared.
* Chooses the most cost-efficient rental vehicles from a given options
* Calculates number of cars needed and number of lodging rooms needed based on passengers
* Provides CLI output in an easy-to-understand format through pandas
* Includes an AWS Lambda handler for a simple JSON API
* Easy to deploy to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) with [SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html)

## Usage
There is no user interface, so the source must be edited directly. The relevant file is ```__init__.py```. Everything else should (probably) be untouched.

Alternatively you can deploy this to AWS Lambda and make requests against it. The easiest way to deploy this is with [SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html). After setting SAM up, run the following commands:
```bash
sam validate; sam build; sam package; sam deploy
```
